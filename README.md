Recoplast is a full-stack web application designed to promote plastic recycling and reward users for their contributions. Users can upload details and images of collected plastic waste, schedule pickups, and earn reward coupons based on the quantity submitted. The platform features a shop where users can redeem coupons for products, an admin dashboard for managing uploads and approvals, and secure authentication for user accounts. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express with MongoDB for the backend, Recoplast aims to encourage sustainable practices through technology and incentives.
